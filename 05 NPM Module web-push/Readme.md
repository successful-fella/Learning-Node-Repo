Lmao did I just did implemented webpush with Node that took me so time before with PHP?

# This DOES NOT mean...
... that PHP is bad. It's just that I already knew what all to do and client side I already had everything set up. But it was a bit smoother expirience tbh.

Here's cred.json file example to be made in this directory:

```javascript
{
    "vapid_array": [
        "mailto:...",
        "public_key",
        "private_key"
    ],
    "endpoint": "...",
    "auth": "...",
    "p256dh": "..."
}
```
