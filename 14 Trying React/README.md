# React App

create-react-app literally saved over 40 thousand files just to have my super simple application created. Wow.
Also JSX is not that bad as I thought it would be.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
